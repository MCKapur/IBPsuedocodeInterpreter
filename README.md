# IBPsuedocodeInterpreter
I'm ahead of my IB HL Computer Science class and hence am working on this project: a pseudocode interpreter specifically for the IB standards. IB has their own pseudocode syntax which must be followed (which in a sense makes it non pseudocode). I think my class would benefit from a way to check their work. This is that.
